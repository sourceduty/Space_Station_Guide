### International Space Station tracking with laser guidance for Raspberry Pi.

Track the International Space Station (ISS) and guide local sightseeing using a custom-mounted laser.

### Parts Needed:

1. Raspberry Pi (Model 4 recommended)
2. GPS module (e.g., Adafruit Ultimate GPS)
3. Small display (e.g., 3.5-inch TFT LCD)
4. Portable monitor (e.g., Lepow Portable Monitor)
5. Strong tactical laser flashlight
6. Mounting hardware for laser flashlight
7. Power source (e.g., battery pack)
8. Cables and connectors
9. Protective case for Raspberry Pi (optional)

### Functionality:

1. Track the position of the ISS using online APIs.
2. Display the ISS's current position on a small display.
3. Utilize GPS to determine the user's location.
4. Notify the user when the ISS is in viewing range based on their GPS coordinates.
5. Power on and point a laser directly at the ISS for sightseeing guidance when it's in viewing range.

This Raspberry Pi ISS Tracking and Laser Sightseeing project aims to combine technology and astronomy enthusiasts' interests by providing a unique way to engage with space exploration. By utilizing a Raspberry Pi, GPS module, small display, and a custom-mounted strong tactical laser flashlight, users can track the International Space Station (ISS) in real-time and receive notifications when it's visible from their location. When the ISS is in viewing range, the system automatically powers on and points a laser directly at the ISS, offering a guided experience for local sightseeing. This project not only fosters an appreciation for space science but also demonstrates the practical applications of Raspberry Pi in creating innovative and interactive experiences for enthusiasts of all ages.

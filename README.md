> Track and guide drones using a custom-mounted laser.

#

This project aims to create a laser guidance system for assisting drones with precise takeoff and landing positioning. Using a Raspberry Pi (preferably Model 4) equipped with a GPS module and a small 3.5-inch TFT display, the system will track the droneâ€™s position in real time within a specific area. A tactical laser flashlight will be custom-mounted and controlled by the Raspberry Pi to emit a laser beam pointing directly at the target location for the drone, helping it align for accurate landings and takeoffs.

The system will use GPS coordinates both from the drone and the ground device to maintain precise tracking. As the drone approaches or departs from the designated landing or takeoff spot, the Raspberry Pi will utilize the GPS module to continually update the droneâ€™s position relative to the target location. This information will be displayed on the small monitor, and the laser beam will be activated to highlight the precise landing or takeoff point, enhancing visibility and accuracy, especially in low-light or visually challenging environments.

To ensure portability, the system includes a compact battery pack to power all components, such as the Raspberry Pi, GPS module, display, and laser. Mounting hardware will securely fix the laser flashlight, allowing stable and accurate beam projection. Cables and connectors will link each component, while an optional protective case can shield the Raspberry Pi from external elements, making the system suitable for outdoor use. This setup will provide drone operators with a reliable tool for guiding drones to exact positions during critical phases of flight.
